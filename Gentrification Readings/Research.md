## What is the problem statement?
- 'lack of accessible information to students about properties' 
- 'the use of students to gentrify areas by exploting the fact that they need housing close to student areas'

## Ideas for the project: 
- Website in a leaflet style 
- giving information about the house styles and prices etc. 
- including an interactive map using potentially storymaps
- could maybe use 360 style photos or videos. 

### Tools:
- storymaps.arcgis.com - will need a university account, email and ask for an account for everyone
- momento 360
- mermaid to create mindmaps or flow charts of data
- [story maps.arcgis website](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/)
- arc collector 
- the census - for data collection. 
- data can be created in excel or build it in VSC saved as a .csv
