# Gentrification 

Newcastle Upon-Tyne has been transformed through gentrification, whilst improving the area and attracted more young professionals and developers, gentrification has created rent prices to rise significantly. 

With Newcastle being a heavily student area, this has led to developers and estate agents using gentrification to rise rent prices to almost unaffordable levels, using the need for housing 

The transformation of affordable housing into upscale developments reduces the availability of affordable options, pushing low-income individuals and families out of the city center and into less desirable areas with fewer resources and opportunities. As well as the influx of wealthier residents can exacerbate economic inequality, widening the gap between affluent newcomers and existing residents who may struggle to afford the rising costs of living. “The rise in property values and rents in these areas has led to concerns about affordability and the displacement of long-term residents. The impact of gentrification on housing affordability is a contentious issue, as it can make it difficult for low-income individuals and families to remain in their neighborhoods.”

- Positive aspects of gentrification in Newcastle include revitalization of neighborhoods, improved infrastructure, and increased economic investment. Areas such as the Quayside, Ouseburn Valley and Jesmond have seen extensive redevelopment, with trendy bars, restaurants, and cultural venues attracting visitors and stimulating local economies. Additionally, gentrification can lead to increased property values, benefiting homeowners and attracting further investment in the area.​
- However, gentrification also brings challenges, particularly for low-income residents who may be priced out of their neighborhoods due to rising rents and property taxes. Displacement can result in the loss of community cohesion and cultural identity as long-term residents are forced to relocate to more affordable areas. Furthermore, gentrification may exacerbate social inequalities, as affluent newcomers may not fully integrate with existing communities, leading to tensions and resentment. "hat these devel-opments—at least in the case of a city suchas Newcastle—should not be viewed as con-stituting ‘gentrification’, fundamentally be-cause   they   have   not   involved   thedisplacement or otherwise disadvantaging ofan existing low-income resident population."

"Higher education students (at least those who can afford to) can choose from a range of high-quality vertical living accommodation in large dedicated purpose-built tower blocks. They are the newest arrivals in theunfolding story of the gentrification of central urban areas." (Chatterton, P. (2010) ‘The Student City: An Ongoing Story of Neoliberalism, Gentrification, and Commodification’, Environment and planning. A, 42(3), pp. 509–514.). Chatterton discusses the idea, that students are now deciding to live in large student block flats instead of 'grotty digs' (Chatterton,2010). owned by estate agents and landlords as they let the conditions that the students live in deteriorate
