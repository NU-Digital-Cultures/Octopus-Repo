## Interactive Map:
This map shows the different areas around Newcastle where students can rent houses from. It differentiates between houses and flats for students to choose from. The map educates on the differing rent prices in Newcastle and has filters to help students choose filter their preferences.

## Narrative Map:
The Narrative Map offers a new perspective on housing in Newcastle. The narrative takes the user through different houses exposing them to 360 degree photos of the house, price of rent and importantly rent for the following year, highlighting to the student the inflation there is in the city.

## Data Visualisation:
The data visualisation again tackles the problem of high rent with the extra information of the varying value of maintenance loan students may receive. It highlights what percentage of a loan it may take out and it educates students on the financial situation they may face when renting in Newcastle.

## Timeline:
The various timelines acts as a checklist / step-by-step guide for students on how to rent a house. This tackles the problem of landlord expoliting students in ways such as: not keeping the house in satisfactory condition, safety hazards and equipment the house must legally need and information on signing contracts.
