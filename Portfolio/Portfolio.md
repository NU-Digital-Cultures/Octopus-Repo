## Interactive Map:
This map shows the different areas around Newcastle where students can rent houses from. It differentiates between houses and flats for students to choose from. The map educates on the differing rent prices in Newcastle and has filters to help students choose filter their preferences.

## Narrative Map:
The Narrative Map offers a new perspective on housing in Newcastle. The narrative takes the user through different houses exposing them to 360 degree photos of the house, price of rent and importantly rent for the following year, highlighting to the student the inflation there is in the city.

## Data Visualisation:
The data visualisation again tackles the problem of high rent with the extra information of the varying value of maintenance loan students may receive. It highlights what percentage of a loan it may take out and it educates students on the financial situation they may face when renting in Newcastle.

## Timeline:
The various timelines acts as a checklist / step-by-step guide for students on how to rent a house. This tackles the problem of landlord expoliting students in ways such as: not keeping the house in satisfactory condition, safety hazards and equipment the house must legally need and information on signing contracts.

### How the prototype was developed to address issues raised by the brief:
The brief exposed three main problems to our group; landlords are charging too high rent prices in Newcastle, landlords fail to maintain to an adequate standard and the problem of gentrification in Newcastle with landlords preying on students. As a group, we decided to use a variety of tools that would be sufficient to aid students. We decided to create an interactive leaflet in the form of a website to educate students on these three problems. The prototype consists of various features including an interactive map, a narrative map, a checklist, data visualisation and reading on gentrification. The first tool, the interactive map is a map of Newcastle which highlights the various areas with prices of rent per week, along with a filter on the side for the student to filter the houses for what is in their budget. This tool addresses the brief as it informs the student on the high house prices set by landlords and the different average prices per area in Newcastle. The narrative tool tackles both the problem of landlords failing to maintain the houses to an adequate level and also the high rent prices. The narrative map takes the student on a journey through houses giving them extra information that would not normally be available to them, including 360-degree photos and information on the inflation of rent prices therefore tackling both the problem of high rent prices and low standard of housing. The data visualisation educates the students on the average rent prices and what percentage of disposable income they face after rent prices, again easing the problem of high rent prices. The timeline in the form of a checklist guides the students along the renting process educating them and hopefully stopping landlords from exploiting students. The reading on gentrification tackles the problem of students not knowing what it is and the problems it can cause them. Overall, the project responds to the brief by providing tools for students to use before renting a house in Newcastle.
