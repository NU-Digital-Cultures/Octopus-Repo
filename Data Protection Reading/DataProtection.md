- Housing sectors, especially those involving rental transactions and management of tenant data, must comply with GDPR. This includes ensuring the lawful processing of tenant data, securing explicit consent for data use, and maintaining transparency about data usage. Housing associations are advised to adopt comprehensive data protection policies that cater to the specifics of the housing industry(Ruparelia, 2024) 

 - GDPR requirements are crucial in the housing sector to protect tenants' data. Housing associations and landlords must ensure data is collected legally and transparently, used only for explicit purposes, and protected against unauthorized access. This is vital when landlords collect personal information that could affect the privacy and security of tenants.

 - Only necessary data should be collected to fulfill specific purposes such as maintenance requests or lease agreements. Excessive data collection
