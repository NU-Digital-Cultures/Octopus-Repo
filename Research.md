## What is the problem statement?
- 'lack of accessible information to students about properties' 
- 'the use of students to gentrify areas by exploting the fact that they need housing close to student areas'

## Ideas for the project: 
- Website in a leaflet style 
- giving information about the house styles and prices etc. 
- including an interactive map using potentially storymaps
- could maybe use 360 style photos or videos. 

### Tools:
- storymaps.arcgis.com - will need a university account, email and ask for an account for everyone
- momento 360
- mermaid to create mindmaps or flow charts of data
- [story maps.arcgis website](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/)
- arc collector 
- the census - for data collection. 
- data can be created in excel or build it in VSC saved as a .csv

## Gentrification in Newcastle:
[Article about Gentrification](https://newcastle.ltd/the-gentrification-and-urban-development-of-newcastle-upon-tyne/)
- "The rise in property values and rents in these areas has led to concerns about affordability and the displacement of long-term residents. The impact of gentrification on housing affordability is a contentious issue, as it can make it difficult for low-income individuals and families to remain in their neighborhoods." 
- The ability of landlords and estate agents to raise rent prices as they know students will need a place to live, causing a whole area to go up in price. 
- Positive aspects of gentrification in Newcastle include revitalization of neighborhoods, improved infrastructure, and increased economic investment. Areas such as the Quayside, Ouseburn Valley and Jesmond have seen extensive redevelopment, with trendy bars, restaurants, and cultural venues attracting visitors and stimulating local economies. Additionally, gentrification can lead to increased property values, benefiting homeowners and attracting further investment in the area.â€‹

- However, gentrification also brings challenges, particularly for low-income residents who may be priced out of their neighborhoods due to rising rents and property taxes. Displacement can result in the loss of community cohesion and cultural identity as long-term residents are forced to relocate to more affordable areas. Furthermore, gentrification may exacerbate social inequalities, as affluent newcomers may not fully integrate with existing communities, leading to tensions and resentment.
