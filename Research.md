## Gentrification in Newcastle:
[Article about Gentrification](https://newcastle.ltd/the-gentrification-and-urban-development-of-newcastle-upon-tyne/)
- "The rise in property values and rents in these areas has led to concerns about affordability and the displacement of long-term residents. The impact of gentrification on housing affordability is a contentious issue, as it can make it difficult for low-income individuals and families to remain in their neighborhoods." 
- The ability of landlords and estate agents to raise rent prices as they know students will need a place to live, causing a whole area to go up in price.
