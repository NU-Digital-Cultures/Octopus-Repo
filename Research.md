## What is the problem statement?
- 'lack of accessible information to students about properties' 
- 'the use of students to gentrify areas by exploting the fact that they need housing close to student areas'

## Ideas for the project: 
- Website in a leaflet style 
- giving information about the house styles and prices etc. 
- including an interactive map using potentially storymaps
- could maybe use 360 style photos or videos. 

### Tools:
- storymaps.arcgis.com - will need a university account, email and ask for an account for everyone
- momento 360
- mermaid to create mindmaps or flow charts of data
- [story maps.arcgis website](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/)

## Literature and readings: 
[Sage Journal Lit paper on Gentrification and urban regeneration](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1080/0042098032000136110)


## Gentrification in Newcastle:
[Article about Gentrification](https://newcastle.ltd/the-gentrification-and-urban-development-of-newcastle-upon-tyne/)
- "The rise in property values and rents in these areas has led to concerns about affordability and the displacement of long-term residents. The impact of gentrification on housing affordability is a contentious issue, as it can make it difficult for low-income individuals and families to remain in their neighborhoods." 
- The ability of landlords and estate agents to raise rent prices as they know students will need a place to live, causing a whole area to go up in price.
