# Octopus-Repo
Team Octopus's repository !!!

## Ideas for the project: 
- Website in a leaflet style 
- giving information about the house styles and prices etc. 
- including an interactive map using potentially storymaps
- could maybe use 360 style photos or videos. 

### Tools
- storymaps.arcgis.com - will need a university account, email and ask for an account for everyone
