Interview with student ?  

Report on gentrification - Jesmond house prices rising due to students from wealthy backgrounds moving into the city ?
Does this actually apply to Jesmond because its a wealthy area anyway ? Is this down to students ? - use articles and other research methods such as questionnaires to find this out 


360s photos - memento 360 
Story maps - website builder and you can add maps to it 

Division of Labour , Assessed on collaboration 
contractual situations
students evictions 
Eviction etc - making that visible 

Create a problem statement - what are we going to address, not solve ,  put sentence in middle of the mindmap

Readings we could use ? Academic literature ? - delegate this, get sources from Nick and Alex 

What data exists already - who would be collecting this data 

SU offer housing support, contract review services 

Find examples, can be used as inspiration 

Start with council data - Dylan ? 

By next week have the task question and divided research 

Data sources notes

Data scraping - go to a website asking for data and data scraping pulls all the data 

RJS- You could create an app that collects data (arc collector) 

Census is probably the most useful - should be useful for postcode level

Hi there,

I'm a second Digital Cultures student currently on a group project looking at falling standards around student housing and an increase in rent prices alongside looking at gentrification in Newcastle. 

Would it be possible to be put in contact with the housing team to see if they have any data, they could provide to assist me and my group with this project? If so, that would be much appreciated.

Many thanks,

Tom Rummels








Hi Thomas
 
This all might be a bit redundant now – sorry I couldn’t reply more quickly.  These is some of the links I have seen recently
 
There are very specific ways in which rent can be increased so tenants should check with Advice Services to see if this is being done correctly.
 
The Student Advice Centre is unable to track local/regional rent increases other than being casually aware of what students are paying from having had sight of tenancy agreements. But we do not log these in any way.  There is also a variety of tenure type as well as property type for rental which means rents can differ quite significantly for reasons such as what they might also include or not include.  We are also aware of the media and other means of information that demonstrate rising rent costs and I have put below some of the sources I am aware of (you likely have already researched these) but might be of use to you.

RPI
 
Many tenancy rent increases are linked to the RPI Index – or they claim to be – whether the landlords actually is or just calculate an arbitrary figure is another matter – we have challenged this in the past.
